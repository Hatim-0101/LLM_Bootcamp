Address: 780 mission street Locality: san francisco Country: united states title 500 security deposit required at check in review hotel may be nice but thoroughly annoyed by the fact that at checkin they required a 500 yes five hundred dollars security deposit on a 775 stay  nothing about it in any fine print i read and what are you going to do standing at the checkin counter trying to use a reservation you made months ago title awful low mclub standards review great room club level very poor standards the standards in the end club are no longer worth having the food is awful by and large and people wander in without even having their cards checked for club privileges  people wandering around in their pajamas at breakfast wearing house slippers its absolutely atrocious ive seen better dressed people at walmart  evening staff in the lounge were incredible breakfast crew awful asian lady on duty mostly hiding in the kitchen the milk had run out 30 minutes ago then she appeared  moved a few plates around and left again terrible experience marriott no longer cares about premium members  i havent been here since 2019 and the standards have dropped through the flow do better marriott and by the way beware the 25 title oversold and sent away review i was confirmed for 2 nights and im a reward member they overbooked and i was walked sent to a less than comparable property about 1 mile away and was told to walk myself there without proper explanation lack of empathy and zero remorse for the inconvenience to me and my work trip this has left a very bad impression of marriott in addition the young staff member who asked me to leave was curt and rude when i asked him to explain what was happening he kept repeating himself and saying as i already explained the hotel is oversold while that may have been a fact that was his administrative burden to bear and i expect a better solution from a corporation like marriiott he said he was mirroring my attitude which was warranted after flying across the country and title hotel is great but the staff truly shines review we visit this property annually for the fan expo which is only a short walk away we have never been dissatisfied the interior of the property is great the lobby is large bright and always beautifully decorated for christmas the rooms have a coffee maker fridge and microwave the rooms are also tastefully decorated and well organized but what makes a special impression on me is the service from check in to the gift shop every employee was friendly and helpful special kudos to sabina at check in who gave my daughter a small box of chocolates at check in to alfonso at the bell desk who had some thoughtful suggestions on where in town to take my daughter during our visit the staff was on point  the hotel offered special rates for those attending the fan expo and i title memorable san francisco review this was a life time stay at the grand hotel of marriott san francisco in city downtown  we stayed for a few days during our visit in the city  this was a great hotel with large lobby and multiple elevators and levels  the rooms a big and ample comfortable to stay service was good since lots of fellow filipino you meet around the hotel  checkin and checkout was fast and easy   thankful for the return of phone we lost in the lobby fortunately it was returned through the lost and found office lady  maraming salamat   nice to meet lady from capiz cashier in the hotel snack bar  to everyone who made our stay safe and enjoyable  thanks title conference hotel with decent size rooms review hotel is large and somewhat impersonal in its public spaces has very much the feel of a conference hotel not one for a romantic weekend away my first room was right outside the service elevator shaft so i had to ask to be moved the second room was much quieter rooms are a good size with firm beds and wellappointed bathrooms for a largish hotel the elevators were fast and efficient too the bar on the top floor was also good i took advantage of the m club as part of our rate which meant a free breakfast and the option of snacks in the evening the breakfast options were plentiful and tasty overall for a large hotel it was a pleasant enough experience although i missed having a swimming pool title stay away  far better options in sf from a long term marriott loyalist review surprised at how terrible this hotels service is being a titanium eliteambassador member this hotel really doesnt appreciate or recognize loyalty and believes in zero customer care   while the overall service is poor they also lost a couple of expensive laundry items and just ignored it after numerous follow ups both in the hotel and after my departure as well with mia who said it wont happen again  benji who hasnt even responded and ellen who looks after rooms  having stayed at hundreds of properties globally over the years its hard to find a hotel with shoddier service anywhere in the world more than shoddy theres such a lack of care for guests that it makes you want to check out as soon as you can while i will never stay here again due to their lack title stay somewhere else review based on reviews i expected so much more rooms are a good size but have nondescript decor this is a megahotel that caters to large conferences so you will be anonymous and lost in a sea of people  you will be nickeled and dimed for everything including a mandatory 25 resort fee sure you can use the resort fee towards purchases in the grab and go commissary but when a large bottle of water is 9 more than at the airport whats your real purchasing power my internet was terrible and i couldnt even logon to do work finally i was charged 15 for a box that was delivered to me there ive never been charged a delivery fee  stay somewhere else with more personality that has basic services included in the base hotel price title nice hotel in a deteriorating area review unfortunately like most of san fransciso the hotel is located in an area with a lot of homeless people trash and just not welcoming for visitors  the facilities themself were very nice  the room was spacious enough very clean and a nice shower  the buffet breakfast was pricey but exceptional the donuts were wonderful  staff was helpful and check in was a breeze although they do put a hold on your cc which was released within a day after we checkout   problem is once you take a step outside youre in a whole different world   title nice convention hotel in san francisco review i stayed here for a large conference  we had a standard room with two queen beds which was excellent  this hotel is located near the powell street bart station and there are a  lot of restaurants in the area  the meeting facilities were excellent  i would recommend this hotel for anyone planning a large event in san francisco title highly recommended review excellent experience the renovations are great the hotel is beautiful and located with within walking distance to the gaslamp district and the ocean    the room was clean with incredible views of the city great pool and starbucks and other food options located on the property   the best part of my experience was the customer service from staff across the board thank you rene dave martiza andy and valet team  highly recommended title great stay  exceeded expectations  review great stayi was starting to doubt the marriott band since covid shut everything down  those of us that have continued to travel have experienced closed restaurants no housekeeping no perks for bonvoy platinum elite members  very low expectations at hotels  marriott marquis san francisco has restored my faith in the marriott brand  great service no problems during my 5 night stay  the perks of breakfast evening happy hour on the second floor was great for bonvoy members  the large security staff is required for this city as the homeless and mentally ill continuing attempt to enter the property  i saw no less that 5 security people ensuring a safe environment at the hotel entrancelobby  target store across the street with a walgreens around the block  valet title beware of hidden fees review very disappointed to have 25 daily fee plus tax forced on us  you can use it for food and drink credit but restaurants and shops have ridiculous exorbitant prices  disappointed in you marriott no mention of this when we booked  we wont be back title be careful with booking details review pleasant and efficient staff reasonable room layout terrible room placement alley view on 7th floor  we got this room because the hotel did not book us into a king room as requested  avoid the blue section of the hotel  hotel cost nearly 400night including taxes would have suggested a premiere room rather than the room we received  the latest checkout that was offered was 1230 pm which really did not help with our schedule and really made no sense as i noted staff cleaning rooms on our hall as late as 4pm during the week  title dumpster fire review what a dump is a war zone this place has been ripping off for years karma is real  the owner of this place has git to be taking a bath now the money grab is over horrible property horrible staff poor management  as an ambassador they tried to charge me 400 to accept my amazon packages  poor wifi ac didnt work tv was snow call 0 and no one picks up the phone beds are old  i hate this dump title no complaints  review recently stayed at this enormous hotel on a very busy weekend  overall i enjoyed it my room faced inward which wasnt that great because the air vents on the lower roofs were quite noisy  thus i didnt open the windows much to enjoy the miraculous san francisco summer weather bring a sweatshirt as nights are chiily even in august nonetheless the seal on the windows was sound proof so the room was pretty silent when the window was closed   the hotel sports an excellent gym with an entire floor dedicated to cardio  really the gym was huge and not too crowded  that was great there is a 25 destinationresort fee  but dont worry as it translates to a credit at hotel restaurant or even better at the market place store in the hotel hint if you purchase 18 of stuff in title i love this place review i love when i get to stay here i cant usually afford it but when ive stayed here its always been wonderful the rooms are great the staff is professional and the location couldnt be more perfect title nice hotel but loud noise from trash trucks at night is annoying at night review the hotel is nice in many respects and the staff is competent and friendly also it is worth noting that the fitness center is quite incredible possibly the biggest and best ive ever seen in a hotel  the main challenge is about the rooms facing the back the view is rather poor but frankly that is not as big of an issue the big issue is that trash dumpsters are in that area and the trash trucks come in the worst possible hours eg 300 am and 600 am during my stay and are extremely loud making it practically impossible to get good sleep  title good experience at san francisco marriott marquis review great experience at the hotel was able to web checkin arrived early and immediately offered a room request for late checkout was granted with no fuss staff provided very good service facilities were clean and room was serviced regularly title a great view  review went for drinks at the view lounge and was really impressed by the view from the 39th floor the bar snacks are clearly priced how ever the drinks arent and although your paying for the view 19 for a glass of wine is a little rich  we opted to pay cash and were a little disappointed when asked to pay the bill before we were ready to leave  title third world response service does not exist review emailed the hotel on 26th july to receive an automatic reply please note this email box is not monitored regularly if your matter is urgent please call the hotel directly at 4158961600  what a joke is this a first world country or  contacted the hotel via facebook and after telling them my inquiry was again asked to call nice seems like the hotel doesnt realise theres international customers and different timezones   will never stay here again title nice review the hotel is huge  lovely spacious lobby with access to mission  4th streets good rooms the service is inconsistent  some staff members were warm while some did not wear a customer hat while the breakfast arena  service were good the spread can be worked on title customer service is not a priority for elite members review i am an elite member and if i leave a review its because my experience was not good  sadly the 5 star reviews are just not indicative of how marriott guests get treated  i called and on bonvoy indicated no tub rooms with view  not only that was ignored they have no sense of customer service  ive stayed in marriott for months at a time and now i am giving them no more of my business  airbnb is the only way im traveling big corporations dont care to train on customs service  after pandemic nothing is good with marriott hotels   title worst hotel ever review dont go to this hotel they dont know what they are doing  service staff enter our room without warning at 8am  our key card was cancelled during our stay and we had to spend one hour discussing with staff just to regain access to our room    we got 25 usd discount for the b55 restaurant the waiter said we should pay with card so we ended up not be able to use the discount   i have been travling all over the world for decades and this hotel is by far the worst i ever have experienced  title okay stay for the business traveler review i travel a few times a year for work it seems most of the hotels i stay at are marriott this location was good no real complaints check in went pretty fast even though there was  a line the elevators confused me a little as i was on the 7th floor and you have to find the blue elevators that are kind of behind the others not a big deal just had to figure it out the bathroom fan did hum all night and my colleague said the same thing happened in their room i was able to tune it out after i fell asleep overall i would stay here again title wonderful weekend getaway  review we did a 3day weekend getaway to san francisco and truly enjoyed our stay at the marriott marquis we arrived on an overnight flight from hawaii and were so thankful we could get an early checkin everyone we encountered from housekeeping front desk the bars and restaurants were so kind and provided great service we loved the view lounge for snacks and drinks along with great food and drinks in bin55 well definitely be back and thank you to everyone at the marriott marquis for an amazing weekend vacation title clean and fresh hotel in a great location review clean hotel in a good location near to transport and union square room was spacious and well equipped would have been nice to have a pool in the hotel breakfast was very expensive so eat elsewhere good bet it you want a central location and clean spacious room title terrible stay rude staff nonworking hvac uncomfortable bed and water leak avoid review pretty much the title hvac didnt work there was a water leak in the room beds and pillows were pretty uncomfortable and when i called the front desk to ask for a 30 minute extension on my checkout they refused and hung up the phone on me when i asked if they can do it as a courtesy given the terrible conditions i will never again stay in this hotel and strongly recommend others avoid it title marriott review the stay was amazing i love the space and the view the blanket on the bed is really cold though we had kept asking the lobby office for a warmer one but they kept giving us the same thing i got really cold at night other than that i completely love the hotel title great stay in sf  review we stayed here for 2 nights and everything was fantastic the bell staff were extremely friendly and gave us quick tips and suggestions anytime we were headed out the rooms were clean and the front desk staff always had a smile we really enjoyed the rooftop bar experience  title if a relaxing executive lounge experience is important to you perhaps book elsewhere review   title nice hotel at a great location  review   title insane rooftop bar

from the moment of checking in where the staff were friendly and smiling and so helpful to the moment of checking out where we were offered a discount on a return visit the hotel experience was superb   a lovely room with a very comfortable bed and plenty of pillows big fluffy towels in the bathroom nice to have both tea facilities and a pod coffee machine in the room we were staying to celebrate

finally the breakfast was superb offering a good selecton of both continental and full english breakfast items from a personal point of view i like scrambled eggs and the ones title excellent meal review excellent lunch and lovely surroundings i dont understand the service charge as a percentage why does it cost more to serve a 70 bottle of wine compared to a 40 bottle why not be honest and just increase all the advertised prices by 125  i would prefer to chose my own amount of tip title nice stay but for me personally a few issues review staid at this hotel several times when it was the

kept bathroom was very nice and there was a few complimentary drinks snacks and biscuits which a lot of hotels now sadly lack there was also a reasonable choice at breakfast and all good quality  after a good night i like to wonder back to the hotel and relax at the bar the bar is too small for the hotel but i can normally get in to the bar or overspill this time when we got back the bar was full so we sat in the other room until someone left this was just after 11 a couple left just after i went into the bar and they title fabulous winter theatre break review fabulous hotel facilities

the food was tasty as we enjoyed an afternoon tea and varied breakfast the room was clean as well thanks to dr fikelephi and her team for making us feel special title impeccable service and the

she has limited mobility and the thought of taking her in a wheelchair was somewhat overwhelming but i had booked sunset boulevard as a trip   the clermont provided the perfect place for us for a pretheatre lunch with my mothers cousin  they had never met before i had rung before to advise my mother would be in a wheelchair  and they found us an accessible table and were happy for mum to remain in her chair  the food was excellent and very reasonably priced and the outlook was fantastic  eating  drinking in a hotel wouldnt necessarily be my first port of call im a food reviewer in edinburgh but i will definitely title booking system is borked support staff mostly unhelpful review im sure the hotel and on site staff are as good as other reviewers report  i unfortunately wont be able to confirm because although i tried extremely hard i was unable to book a reservation at this hotel i tried booking directly through their own web site which resulted in confusing error messages and multiple auths on my credit card several attempts with different cards on different days so it wasnt me but sadly no reservation i tried calling twice and wasted 33 usd on international phone calls only to remain on hold because the accommodations department never picked up the phone while tryingfailing to get them on the phone and hoping that one of my auths would convert to a charge their nightly rate went up and made the stay over budget for us i resorted title an elegantly presented hotel rich in londons heritage a perfect central location for tourists review we stayed for one night in a deluxe room on the 6th floor with a view of the back of charing cross train station and office block not overly impressive however we could see houses of parliament in the distance  the hotel has rich and historic architecture high ceilings large georgian windows swooping brass stair case tastefully decorated for christmas while we are from the uk it was lovely to see a relic red phone box down a corridor close to the lobby the checkin process was very quick our bags were taken from us upon entering and taken immediately to the room the hotels location is ideal for those visiting the west end as we were strand piccadilly circus trafalgar sq conveniently backing onto charing cross station one of the easiest hotels to get to in my title christmas in london  claremont charing cross  wonderful review my family and i just returned from a week long stay in london over the christmas week  the claremont  charing cross was the ideal property for our visit   the hotel was centrally located  on the strand with very nice rooms and just the right amenities   the hotel was festively decorated and made us feel like we were at home for the week  the entirety of the hotel staff including the food and beverage manager mrs jackson couldnt do enough for us and made our stay very special  if considering a trip to london put the claremont  charing cross at the top of the list for your stay   title new years eve meal with friends review we booked dinner for 3 and were delighted with our whole experience generous and comfortable seating with a panoramic view of christmas in the very centre of london the service we received was charming and quietly efficient and the food we enjoyed was exquisite without exception this constituted 3 3course meals wine and coffee it was good value for money as we have paid more  in other establishments that were less excellent the hotel itself has a stateliness but it was warmly and sympathetically decorated it was a delight to see the main staircase and the elegant furnishings already planning our next visit title beautiful hotel in the heart of london review our family traveled to the uk for christmas our 3 adult kids had to return to the usa on dec 27th but my husband and i were staying on i chose this beautiful hotel because of the availability of 3 rooms excellent location and convenience getting to heathrow we were warmly welcomed given free cocktails at the bar had lovely rooms with all the amenities and had a great nights sleep dont hesitate to book here for an excellent hotel right in the heart of london title christmas at the clermont review this is the first year we have spent christmas away from home  it had to be the clermont  this is our 5th stay this year we were greeted by happy smiling staff  this continued all throughout our stay breakfast time was lovely  very special thanks to cyan  thanks to ruvim  faycal we had a wonderful meal in the restaurant on christmas eve followed by a gorgeous christmas day dinner special thanks to konrad svetlana  rosie for organising things so well to elsa  keerty for being the most amazing waiting staff big thankyou to daphne for

at breakfast  konrad keertie at dinner made my stay akshay the chef was flexible in making plain rice for my grand son nothing was too much trouble cristi made my zombie the i like it thank you clermont for a fantastic birthday title we only stayed one night of our five night reservation review we booked two rooms for five nights at the clermont based on their excellent reviews and their central location we found the hotel to be confusing we had to go up a flight of stairs and then cross an interior bridge connecting two buildings then go down a flight of stairs to get to our rooms the staircase smelled like a hamsters cage the rooms we were given were very dark and faced a narrow interior space of the hotel there were workers outside our windows doing some building work we could hear them speaking through the walls one of our rooms had no hot water for showering both of our rooms had a queen comforter on a kingsized bed this meant when one person rolled over they took the covers with them why not put a kingsized comforter on a kingsized bed there is title perfect for those wanted an elevated london experience review the clermont charing cross london was the perfect hotel for first time travelers to london we are from the us and wanted a hotel that was centrally located  we could not have chosen a better place  the location was perfect  it was steps away from trafalgar square two tube locations were literally on the property and rail service was in the bottom of the hotel  the staff was kind and accommodating and the entire hotel was extremely clean our room was appointed with a king bed updated bathroom and plenty of pillow options so we were comfortable  the room was very clean the downsides were minimal and hardly worth mentioning but i will so someone else will know what to expect  i used the blow dryer provided in the room which was on the high end side which was nice title couples trip  excellent stay review lovely place to stay right in the heart of london easy walking routes to everywhere and good tube links   the room was lovely considering the age of the building and location i thought the room would be smaller bed and bedding was really high quality   the shower was so powerful you dont want to get out of it   only small amount of rail noise to be expected but it was so small you didnt really notice it view could have been better arches facing room but it was a busy period so its not really a complaint plus if youre going to london youre not sitting in your room staring at the view for long really   service is very professional and friendly  title perfect hotel review best hotel ive every stayed in i travel a lot for work and this ticks all the boxes and more from arrival to leaving the staff were incredibly helpful and kind like they were proud of the place they worked and wanted guests to have the best possible experience room was incredible cosy and immacuately clean and was full of extras and thoughtful details that even as a seasoned traveller i always have to ask for or hadnt even thought about but very much appreciated sweetie jar coffee machine and selection of coffees wide selection of teas and hot chocolate hairdryer ironing board iron fluffy robe and slippers luxury bedding and bed shower that works is hot and powerful and is easy to use even without spectacles lovely toiletries too and a bath lots of title afternoon tea disappointment review we went to the restaurant for afternoon tea  which used to be a thing in the old hotel there  and is still advertised   so the scones were stale and the whole thing both inadequate and expensive   i suppose going on on monday you might expect to get the weekend leftvoers  but it was very poor title annual room for christmas party  review work put us up for the usual christmas party  the room was decent but not a great view this time even though it was mostly to sleep off the hangover the location is perfect for central london bars restaurantsetc great breakfast will most likely be back next year for the annual christmas party title first class location  review highly recommend this hotel its an oasis of calm right in the centre of london you can walk to everything and its so handy to be able to pop back to drop off shopping or just for a sit down   its a very large old hotel right above charing cross station but very well run and maintained staff are friendly and helpful hopefully we will be back  title christmas treat review took my wife for a meal in the restaurant for a christmas treat  the decor was amazingstaff very professionalhelpful and attentive  the food itself was greatmy wife is vegan and she was well catered forall three courses were amazing  i would definitely recommend a visit  title great location for west end musicals review excellent location for the places i visited and my travel preference only  short journey by tube from victoria station to charring cross i would highly recommend this hotel if going to a west end musical as you can walk out of the hotel and youre about 5 minutes walk  to the adelphi theatre there was other shows all within 10  15 minutes walk away i didnt eat at the hotel so cant comment on food the staff where all friendly and the room was very clean there was a mini bar with some free coke and water in there as well as your normal tea coffee hot chocolate ect and a some snacks crisps popcorn biscuits and sweets there was lots of other facilities like gym which i also didnt use title terrible experience  review the room they put my family and i in was awful if reception ever say to you to cross the bridge decline immediately the hotel is part of two buildings the very nice building that smells like christmas in the winter then theres the building above five guys that stinks of burgers and terrible cleaning products we instantly complained about this so they upgraded us to the nicer part of the building all is well however the reception is sneaky   when my mum and dad complained reception told them they were no rooms available but when i complained they upgraded me and told me that i would have to pay 40 per night so we were separated for 1 of 2 nights however the day after my parents asked again and reception gave them an upgrade too but for free i was fuming at title loved our stay review great location nice breakfast buffet staff friendly and accommodating rooms clean and comfortable love the goodies filled in the candy dish nice touch highly recommend and would definitely stay there again title perfect review excellent hotel superb building in a perfect location beautifully presented and decorated and staff were fabulous the room bar restaurant and breakfast were all exceptional will most definitely recommend and will stay again if we are ever in london again  title amazing first class service at the restaurant  review we went for a lunch in the hotel restaurant and we were so impressed with service and food was absolutely great from beginning to the end  such attentive staff 3 course lunch and glass of bubbly incredible price  title much better than expected review very recommended hotel in a perfect location near trafalgar square  underground bus stationstheaters  room and bathroom are very clean nice and good service coffee machine tea sweets cookiesbeautiful decoration in christmas 5 stars thank you title christmas visit to london review the staff were exceptionally welcoming with nothing being too much trouble we were delighted with the service provided and the room was excellent special thanks to the brilliant staff on reception who were always happy to help title great location clean  review hotel is well located within walking distance to tube station thames and covent garden  taxi rank right outside front door  comfortable beds clean   the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 has to do with temperature control loudness  and special requests  i had requested a bath tub multiple times but they were not able to accommodate  the temperature of the room was hot and the thermostat did not seem to adjust temperature  we were able to open window but the street noise was loud on the weekend staff was nice   title quiet but pretty review i visited the restaurant this visit but have stayed here before and the room was nice this visit the restaurant accommodated us even though we were almost an hour late due to train strikes nice cocktails well presented companion said vegan burger was okay little bit chilly where we were seated but beautiful christmas decor title a perfect hotel review most accommodating staff very lovely rooms with extremely comfortable beds the location was perfect for anyone wanting to be near the theaters i especially liked that they offered to book a car service to the airport and the cost was the same or less than a cab title do not get off at charing cross clermont review so little good to say  staff is untrained uncoordinated and often incompetent  room  bed comfy bath insanely bad  functional furnishings are absent and the place is tired compared to its sister property at victoria station   title fabulous hotel  review a very enjoyable stay wonderful christmas decorations throughout hotel smelt of christmas the staff at check in were so friendly and accommodating the staff make this hotel they were all so kind welcoming and attentive thank you to the man who made me a cup of tea on arrival the breakfast was superb and served in beautiful surroundings this hotel is great value the location is perfect  so central very comfortable room and clean just perfect  highly recommend  one issue was our shower it went hot and cold was fine as we could use it but maybe a maintence issue we were room 611 i forgot to say on check out thanks again ill be back  title convenient with good food and attentive service review we were not staying but arranged to meet a friend at the terrace restaurant which proved an excellent choice  easy for him to reach because right next to charing cross station and convenient for us as we were going on to an exhibition at the national gallery  we had a good light lunchtime meal and we especially appreciated the quiet room background music very muted which enabled us to have a really good conversation in the restaurants attractive room title other great stay review the clermont is my hotel of choice when i need to stay in london on business i am fortunate to be able to stay several times a year and this hotel is consistently good with great service delicious food and spacious rooms it is in a really good location and the rooms are clean quiet and comfortable i always look forward to my stay highly recommended title fabulous hotel look forward to returning one day review great hotel in a fantastic location the hotel was beautifully decorated for christmas we were 2 adults and a teenager beds were very comfortable with plenty of pillows and blankets snacks drinks and wine in room were free of charge so it was nice to have while getting ready to head back out for the evening bathroom was a great size with a fabulous shower hotel was quiet even though there seemed to be a lot of guests  although room was nice  space was extremely limited with sofa bed opened storage was quite limited super conveniently located for walking to just about all sites to visit or theres a tube station is right next door and another line just down the street plenty of coffee shops right across the street to grab breakfast uber for the most part was very title excellent choice for pretheatre dining review pretheatre dining  lovely atmosphere in the restaurant the staff were polite friendly and nothing was too much trouble the menu had enough choice to cater for different dietary requirements and the food was delicious we left well set up for our evening at the theatre title great property  review the hotel is perfectly located next to the charing cross station but we didnt hear nor feel any train activity the property was beautifully decorated both their permanent and holiday decor were equally tasteful the staff was attuned to any request we may have had and were very responsive and attentive we will definitely stay at the clermont in the future \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
